# Triple-X-With-the-Lives-Feature
Triple X is a console app game that allows players to guess the three numbers of a given sum and product.

The game has set the default number of lives to 5 and the difficulty increases progressively.

It is my first ever "game" thus future improvements are expected.

Enjoy the guess!
